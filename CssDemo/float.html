    <p>Angkor Wat (/ˌæŋkɔːr ˈwɒt/; Khmer: អង្គរវត្ត, "City/Capital of Temples") is a temple complex in Cambodia, located
        on a site measuring 162.6 hectares (1,626,000 m2; 402 acres). The Guinness World Records considers it as the
        largest religious structure in the world.[2] Originally constructed as a Hindu temple[1] dedicated to the god
        Vishnu for the Khmer Empire by King Suryavarman II during the 12th century, it was gradually transformed into a
        Buddhist temple towards the end of the century; as such, it is also described as a "Hindu-Buddhist"
        temple.[3][4]

        Angkor Wat was built at the behest of the Khmer King Suryavarman II[5] in the early 12th century in
        Yaśodharapura (Khmer: យសោធរបុរៈ, present-day Angkor), the capital of the Khmer Empire, as his state temple and
        eventual mausoleum. Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the temple-mountain and
        the later galleried temple. It is designed to represent Mount Meru, home of the devas in Hindu mythology: within
        a moat more than 5 kilometres (3 mi) long[6] and an outer wall 3.6 kilometres (2.2 mi) long are three
        rectangular galleries, each raised above the next. At the centre of the temple stands a quincunx of towers.
        Unlike most Angkorian temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west; scholars are divided as to the significance
        of this. The temple is admired for the grandeur and harmony of the architecture, its extensive bas-reliefs, and
        for the numerous devatas adorning its walls. The modern name Angkor Wat, alternatively Nokor Wat,[7] means
        "Temple City" or "City of Temples" in Khmer. Angkor (អង្គរ ângkôr) meaning "city" or "capital city", is a
        vernacular form of the word nokor (នគរ nôkôr), which comes from the Sanskrit/Pali word nagara (Devanāgarī:
        नगर).[8] Wat (វត្ត vôtt) is the word for "temple grounds", also derived from Sanskrit/Pali vāṭa (Devanāgarī:
        वाट), meaning "enclosure".[9]</p>

    <p>Towards the end of the 12th century, Angkor Wat gradually transformed from a Hindu centre of worship to Buddhism,
        which continues to the present day.[4] Angkor Wat is unusual among the Angkor temples in that although it was
        largely neglected after the 16th century, it was never completely abandoned.[17] Fourteen inscriptions dated
        from the 17th century, discovered in the Angkor area, testify to Japanese Buddhist pilgrims that had established
        small settlements alongside Khmer locals.[18] At that time, the temple was thought by the Japanese visitors to
        be the famed Jetavana garden of the Buddha, which was originally located in the kingdom of Magadha, India.[19]
        The best-known inscription tells of Ukondayu Kazufusa, who celebrated the Khmer New Year at Angkor Wat in
        1632.[20]

        One of the first Western visitors to the temple was António da Madalena, a Portuguese friar who visited in 1586
        and said that it "is of such extraordinary construction that it is not possible to describe it with a pen,
        particularly since it is like no other building in the world. It has towers and decoration and all the
        refinements which the human genius can conceive of."[21]</p>

    <p>Angkor Wat is the prime example of the classical style of Khmer architecture—the Angkor Wat style—to which it has
        given its name. By the 12th century, Khmer architects had become skilled and confident in the use of sandstone
        (rather than brick or laterite) as the main building material. Most of the visible areas are sandstone blocks,
        while laterite was used for the outer wall and hidden structural parts. The binding agent used to join the
        blocks is yet to be identified, although natural resins or slaked lime has been suggested. The temple is a
        symbol of Cambodia and is a source of national pride that has factored into Cambodia's diplomatic relations with
        France, the United States, and its neighbour Thailand. A depiction of Angkor Wat has been a part of Cambodian
        national flags since the introduction of the first version circa 1863.[33] From a larger historical and
        transcultural perspective, however, the temple of Angkor Wat did not become a symbol of national pride sui
        generis but had been inscribed into a larger politico-cultural process of French-colonial heritage production in
        which the original temple site was presented in French colonial and universal exhibitions in Paris and Marseille
        between 1889 and 1937.[
